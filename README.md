# Self-study Machine Learning

## About the book that I have studied

The book, **Python Machine Learning (3rd Edition)** or **머신러닝 교과서 (개정 3판)** in Korean, lets you introduce the mathematical theories and computational algorithms behind the models by using a lot of practical examples and step-by-step tutorials on each chapter.
All the examples and tutorials in this book are based on the [Python](https://python.org/) language with efficient machine learning libraries and frameworks such as [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
You can find my self-studied chapter notes (written in Jupyter Notebook, source code referenced from the book) under the [notes folder](./notes).
If you are interested to study on your own with this book, visit the official book Github repository links below.

## About the tutorials that I have studied

My hands-on experience in TensorFlow tutorials are all under the [tutorials folder](./tutorials).
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) utilizes [Keras](https://keras.io/), which built on top of TensorFlow version 2, that enable beginners to easily build neural network models by adding built-in layers into the Keras sequential model.
For advanced experts, Keras provides APIs for functional and subclassing models to support more flexible model creation and customization.
For more information about Keras models, visit [Keras Docs](https://keras.io/api/).
If you are interested to learn and explore more in-depth contents about TensorFlow by yourself, visit [TensorFlow tutorials page](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) or [TensorFlow GitHub](https://github.com/tensorflow/docs).
