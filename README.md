This repo is all about my study on machine learning. :computer:

## guide

Python Machine Learning (Korean translated version known as 머신러닝 교과서 개정 3판) is a well-known, complete guide to machine learning and deep learning with [Python](https://python.org/). It also lets you introduce the mathematical theories and algorithms behind the models by using a lot of practical examples and step-by-step tutorials.
All the examples and tutorials are based on the Python language with efficient machine learning libraries and frameworks such as [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
You can find all the summarized chapter notes (written in Jupyter Notebook) under the [guide](./guide/) folder.
If you are interested to learn machine learning on your own with this book, visit the GitHub repository links below for more information including the supplementary example source codes.

## tutorial

All my hands-on tutorials are under the [tutorial](./tutorial) folder.
Most of my notebooks are directly from [TensorFlow tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) and [Keras examples](https://keras.io/examples/) where they provide tons of informative tutorials for both machine learning beginners and experts to have a deep dive into the world of AI through their impressive open source machine learning framework.
TensorFlow utilizes [Keras](https://keras.io/), which is built on top of TensorFlow version 2, that enables beginners to easily build deep neural networks by adding built-in layers into the Keras sequential model.
For advanced machine learning experts, Keras provides efficient APIs for functional and subclassing models to support more flexible model creation and even customization.
For more information and documentation about Keras, visit [Keras](https://keras.io/api/).
In addition, if you are interested to learn and explore more in-depth contents about TensorFlow by yourself, visit [TensorFlow tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) or [TensorFlow GitHub](https://github.com/tensorflow/docs).
